# Update:
1. Check reconstruct time
>Instead of the end of year, the most possible reconstruct time is July. Because lots of US company would release the annual report before end of June. So investors can get the ESG data after that. Thus, I think July is a good time for us to set as portfolios reconstruct time. Compare the result after adjusting the reconstruct time!
2. Back-testing
>Comparing with the standard of asset like S&P500 and T-bill.
3. Conduct the deeper research for E,S and G score in model. (Through ML, finding the key variables.)
4. Run regression for specific periods such as 2020/02 - 2020/03 to check whether there is still excess-return. (Our data don't include 2008, maybe we need to extend it?)
5. Eigen-portfolio vs Value-weighted / Equal-weighted (Check Andrew HW)
