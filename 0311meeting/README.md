# Update:
1. Conduct the deeper research for E,S and G score in model. (Through ML, finding the key variables.)
2. Back-testing 
3. Run regression for specific periods such as 2020/02 - 2020/03 to check whether there is still excess-return. (Our data don't include 2008)
4. Check reconstruct time
5. Eigen-portfolio vs Value-weighted / Equal-weighted
